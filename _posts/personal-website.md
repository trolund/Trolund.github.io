This article describes my experience of using Next.js with headless CMS (Content Management System). 

This project was started when Next.js **eleven** was the latest and greatest and was later updated to use Next.js **d**. At the time of writing Next.js **f** is the latest release, this project may be updated in the further bu will at the moment remain using this version.

Next.js was Chosen simply Because i had used i for Previous project and found the developer experience quiet joyful.
