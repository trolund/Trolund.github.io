Recast.tv offers paid content, but I prefer not to spend too much. They have a program where you can earn points by watching ads, which you can then use to purchase the content you want. To make this process easier, I created a small Python script using Selenium to automatically "watch" the ads for you. This way, you can get on with your life while earning points.

You can use the script yourself by running it from here: [RecastEarner on GitHub](https://github.com/trolund/recast-earner/blob/master/main.py).

Simply enter your Recast.tv credentials in the code where indicated by the comments.
