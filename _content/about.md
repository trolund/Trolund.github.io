I am Troels Lund, a software engineer based on Frederiksberg, Denmark. With a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering and two years of experience as a full-stack developer, I have recently completed my master's education in Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

My fascination with IT developed early in life, leading me to cultivate a comprehensive understanding of various computer science domains.

Beyond coding, I thrive on sports activities, having proudly represented the national sprint kayaking team for six years. I also relish spending time outdoors, staying active through training, and creating cherished moments with my girlfriend.

Professionally, I derive immense satisfaction from working with technologies such as .NET, React.js, Next.js, Java, TypeScript, T-SQL, and Git. With a commitment to delivering tangible outcomes and a profound grasp of agile methodologies, I prioritize user-centric approaches in my projects. Continual learning is integral to my ethos, and I eagerly anticipate further enriching my skills and expertise.
