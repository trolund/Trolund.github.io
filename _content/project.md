This page is dedicated to showcasing some of the projects I have worked on, both as part of my education and as personal hobby projects. This does not include projects i have done as part of my day job(s). Here, you will find a collection of my endeavors, ranging from academic assignments to independent creative pursuits. It serves as a platform to document and share my journey of exploration and growth. While some projects may have been developed in a structured educational setting, others reflect my passion and curiosity outside the confines of a formal curriculum. Feel free to explore and discover the diverse range of projects I have undertaken.
