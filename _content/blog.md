This blog page is primarily for myself, so that in 10 years I can remember some of the small projects and experiments I have done over time. Some of them are based on lecture notes, others on assignments, and some are just hobby projects. If others want to read along, they are welcome, although not all posts are polished, so please refrain from being too judgmental.
